## üêõ Debug Checklist

### If Model Fails to Load
```
Error loading model: Unable to load asset
```
- [ ] Check file exists: `assets/models/mobilefacenet.tflite`
- [ ] Check pubspec.yaml has `assets/models/`
- [ ] Run `flutter clean`
- [ ] Rebuild app

### If Face Detection Fails
```
Error processing image: PlatformException
```
- [ ] Check camera format (should be NV21)
- [ ] Check logs for format details
- [ ] Try different camera resolution

### If Embedding Extraction Fails
```
Error extracting embedding: [error]
```
- [ ] Check model loaded (`_interpreter != null`)
- [ ] Check input shape [1, 112, 112, 3]
- [ ] Check image cropping succeeded
- [ ] Check resize succeeded

### If API Call Fails
```
L·ªói k·∫øt n·ªëi API: Connection refused
```
- [ ] Backend is running
- [ ] Correct URL (localhost vs IP)
- [ ] Network connectivity
- [ ] CORS enabled on backend
